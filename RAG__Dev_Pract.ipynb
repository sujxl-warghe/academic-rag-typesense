    "# **📚 RAG-Based Academic Answering System**\n",
    "### *Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Exam-Oriented, Reference-Based Answers*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **✅ Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "In today’s academic world, AI tools like **ChatGPT** have become very common for learning and answer writing. But a serious issue has emerged: many students directly copy AI-generated answers **without syllabus alignment, without references, and sometimes with incorrect/irrelevant content**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This became clearly visible in our **3rd semester exams**, where some students wrote answers using ChatGPT, and teachers **did not award marks**. In fact, it was clearly stated that answers written directly from ChatGPT would not be accepted.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🎯 Goal of This Project**\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, this notebook focuses on building a **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system** — an AI assistant that generates answers **only after retrieving content from trusted academic sources** such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 📄 Teacher-provided notes  \n",
    "- 📘 Textbooks  \n",
    "- 🗂️ College PDFs / Question banks  \n",
    "- 📝 Syllabus-oriented study material  \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of giving generic internet-based answers, this system produces **document-grounded responses** that are more reliable and exam-appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🌟 Why RAG?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A standard chatbot may generate fluent answers, but it can:\n",
    "- ❌ hallucinate (give wrong information)\n",
    "- ❌ ignore the syllabus\n",
    "- ❌ provide vague or over-general responses\n",
    "- ❌ lack sources/references\n",
    "\n",
    "A **RAG-based system** improves this by ensuring:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Syllabus-oriented answers**  \n",
    "✅ **Trustworthy and factual content**  \n",
    "✅ **Reference-backed generation**  \n",
    "✅ **Less hallucination / higher accuracy**  \n",
    "✅ **Teacher-acceptable content**  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🧠 What This Notebook Implements**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook builds a complete **RAG Pipeline**, step-by-step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 📥 Load academic documents (PDF/notes/text)\n",
    "2. ✂️ Split text into meaningful chunks\n",
    "3. 🧾 Generate embeddings for semantic search\n",
    "4. 🗃️ Store embeddings into a vector database\n",
    "5. 🔎 Retrieve top relevant chunks for a query\n",
    "6. 🤖 Generate final answer using LLM grounded in retrieved context\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🏁 Outcome**\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this notebook, we will have an **Academic RAG Assistant** that can generate:\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 **Exam-focused answers**  \n",
    "📌 **Reliable content from given documents**  \n",
    "📌 **Reference-supported responses**  \n",
    "\n",
    "This makes the output more authentic, more accurate, and suitable for academic evaluation.\n",

More specifically, an actuator is a \\ndevice that converts input energy into motion or mechanical energy. Here source energy can \\nbe pneumatic, hydraulic, or electric type, and motion produced (by actuator) can be either linear \\nor rotary. For example, an electric motor uses electrical energy to create a rotational movement \\nto turn on an object, or to move an object. A tire jack or screw jack uses mechanical energy to \\nprovide enough force to lift a car. In short, an actuator converts some type of energy into \\nmotion. Actuators include motors, gears, pumps, pistons, valves, and switches. \\n \\nAn actuator needs a control device that is governed by a control signal and an energy source.   -'),\n",
